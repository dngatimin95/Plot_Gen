# Plot Generator: Unleash Anime Imagination

Harnessing the buzz surrounding Language Models and fueled by my completion of the DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Certificate course, I ventured into crafting a realm of my own unique anime narratives. Inspired by the captivating "This Anime does not exist" project, where AI generates random unique anime characters, I embarked on generating anime summaries that fuel the imagination.

## So what does this repo do?
This repository serves as a haven for crafting anime summaries that spring forth from the wellspring of creativity. Drawing from 500 scraped anime summaries sourced from MyAnimeList website, the project fashions a tapestry of new tales. The summary-scraping process is orchestrated by Selenium, meticulously assembling each essence into a text file. The project takes a dual-pronged approach to text generation: an LSTM model, an older yet reliable text generation method, and a GPT2 transformer, showcasing the novel progressions in AI text generation.
